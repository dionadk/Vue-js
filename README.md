## About Vue-js

## Why did you choose this subject?
 Its component based and similiar to react
## How were you first made aware of it?
  Saw a project built in vuw js from a previous wdi student
## What problem does it solve?

## How does it solve the problem (conceptually)? and Why does one use it?
 Vue is slightly ahead due to its lighter-weight Virtual DOM implementation
 HTML-based templates make it much easier to progressively migrate existing applications to take advantage of Vueâ€™s reactivity features.
 Single-file components give you full access to CSS in the same file as the rest of your component code.
You also get syntax highlighting, CSS support and easier use of preprocessors like Jade or SCSS

##What are the alternatives? and What is it similar to, if anything?
Vue.js, an alternative to Angular and React

##What is the history of this technology? Who built it and why?

Vue was created by Evan You after working for Google using AngularJS in a number of projects. He later summed up his thought process, "I figured, what if I could just extract the part that I really liked about Angular and build something really lightweight without all the extra concepts involved"
It was first released in February 2014 by ex-Google-employee Evan You

##What is your opinion on the technology after having built something with it?
Its not that complicated. I built a simple todo-app with crud functionality
learned how to use parent and child components and data exchange between them
##What are the biggest conceptual hurdles (if any) you encountered when researching this?
Listen to an event using $on(eventName)
Trigger an event using $emit(eventName)
In addition, a parent component can listen to the events emitted from a child component using v-on directly in the template where the child component is used.
